# Predicting-Who-Is-Diabetic
Dataset: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

**Problem Statement:** 
*My goal for this personal data project was to use binary classification on a dataset originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases about the Pima People to predict if patient has diabetes or not.*

**Impact**

This model will help predict the onset of diabetes in women who are a part of Pima People community.

**Stakeholders**
Health care professionals
Hospitals

**Scope (systems used)**
Jupyter Lab, Python, Supervised Learning: Classification, Logistic Regression, Matplotlib, Gradient Descent

**Metrics(what is being tracked)**
Available features from dataset are: Pregnancies, Blood Pressure, Glucose, BMI, Skin Thickness, Insulin, and Age

After various readings online I hypothesized BMI and Glucose will be the two best features used in conjuction to predict if a patient is diabetic or not.

**Tasks**

    1. Review data to get an initial understanding.
        - Do basic statistics.
        - Visualize patients with a postive diabetes test result(1) using original BMI vs Glucose
    1. Define Logistic Model
    1. Define Cost Function
    1. Defie Gradient Function
    1. Define Gradient Descent Function
    1. Define Prediction Function
    1. Store predicted results in dataframe and export csv
    1. Visualize predicted results.
